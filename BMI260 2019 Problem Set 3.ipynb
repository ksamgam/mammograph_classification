    "\n",
    "Breast cancer has the highest incidence and second highest mortality rate for women in the US.\n",

    "Your task is to utilize machine learning to study mammograms in any way you want (e.g. classification, segmentation) as long as you justify why it is useful to do whatever it is you want to do. Turning in a deep dream assignment using mammograms might be amusing, for example, but not so useful to patients. That being said, choose something that interests you. As the adage goes, \"do what you love, and you’ll never have to work another day in your life, at least in BMI 260.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Treat this as a mini-project. We highly encourage working with 1 other person, possibly someone in your main project team. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the mammograms themselves, the dataset includes \"ground-truth\" segmentations and `mass_case_description_train_set.csv`, which contains metadata information about mass shapes, mass margins, assessment numbers, pathology diagnoses, and subtlety in the data. Take some time to research what all of these different fields mean and how you might utilize them in your work. You don't need to use all of what is provided to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the ROI’s or segmentations to extract features, and then train a classifier based on those features using the algorithms presented to you in the machine learning lectures (doesn't need to use deep learning).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use convolutional neural networks. Feel free to use any of the code we went over in class or use your own (custom code, sklearn, keras, Tensorflow etc.). If you dont want to place helper functions and classes into this notebook, place them in a `.py` file in the same folder called `helperfunctions.py` and import them into this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is here:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/CBIS-DDSM\n",
    "\n",
    "## Grading and Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment has 3 components: code, figures (outputs/analyses of your code), and a write-up detailing your mini-project. You will be graded on these categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're OK with Python or R, please place all three parts into this notebook/.Rmd file that we have provided where indicated. We have written template sections for you to follow for simplicity/completeness. When you're done, save as a `.pdf` (please knit to `.pdf` if you are using `.Rmd`, or knit to `.html` and use a browser's \"Print\" function to convert to `.pdf`).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't like Python OR R, we will allow you to use a different language, but please turn your assignment in with: 1) a folder with all your code, 2) a folder with all your figures, and 3) a `.tex`/`.doc`/`.pdf` file with a write-up."

Plt.imshow() might show similar images but if you use the color bar function then the pixel values may be different. There are built in functions to normalize it. Or you can find the mean and standard deviation, and take z-score range. But there's also packages that deal with it. Normalize either (0,1) or (0,255) so long they're comparable values between images. \n",
